# Population dynamics of desert tortoise *Gopherus agassizii* 
In university we had to study how the population of a species could change if the right conservation decisions were made. In my case, we chose this cutie right here:

This tortoise is native to the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Several demographic studies showed that the species population was in decline. It has to deal with several human threats and environmental challenges like climate change, habitat degradation, car crashes, diseases or poaching. 

The projections made in the script are based on 3 main threats:
- Cattle grazing
- Predation by ravens
- Upper respiratory tract disease
